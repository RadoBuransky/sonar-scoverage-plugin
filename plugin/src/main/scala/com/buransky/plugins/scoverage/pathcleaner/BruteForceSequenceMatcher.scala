/**
  * Helper that allows to convert a report path into a source folder relative path by testing it against
  * the tree of source files.
  * 
  * Assumes that all report paths of a given report have a common root. Dependent of the scoverage
  * report this root is either something outside the actual project (absolute path), the base dir of the project
  * (report path relative to base dir) or some sub folder of the project.
  * 
  * By reverse mapping a report path against the tree of all file children of the source folder the correct filesystem file
  * can be found and the report path can be converted into a source dir relative path.  *
